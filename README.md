### Hi there! 👋

My name is Kasper Maarschalk Hytting. 
I am working as a computer vision and AI engineer at The LEGO Group, where I solve real-world manufacturing challenges and explore state-of-the-art, research-driven vision projects beyond manufacturing. 

I hold a Masters degree in Robotics Engineering from Aalborg University.
